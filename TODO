general
 - complete makefile
 - grammar
    - acc/rej (also after actions!)
    - dotdot for ranges
 - simplifications
    - <> -> nothing
    - <<><>> -> nothing
    - ='p'='q' -> ='q'
    - ='p'<>='q' -> ='q'
    - main { a } a { < end } -> main { < end }
    - main { ['0'] a ['1'] a } -> main { ['0', '1'] a }
    - ='p'<<='q'>>='p'<='r'< -> <='r'<='q'
    - minimization of ranges and charvar
    - more complex minimizations

abstract
 - grammar
    - comments
    - dot notation to save parentheses
 - compiler
    - short name mode
    - real executable instead of parse_test

concrete
 - more control over simulation
