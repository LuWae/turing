general
 - comments (doxygen?)
 - complete makefile
 - grammar
    - acc/rej (also after actions!)
    - dotdot for char ranges
    - @ for current state ### not needed anymore, since stay will be implicit
 - simplifications
    - <> -> nothing
    - <<><>> -> nothing
    - ='p'='q' -> ='q'
    - ='p'<>='q' -> ='q'
    - main { a } a { < end } -> main { < end }
    - main { ['0'] a ['1'] a } -> main { ['0', '1'] a }
    - ='p'<<='q'>>='p'<='r'< -> <='r'<='q'
    - minimization of ranges and charvar
    - more complex minimizations (space vs. time? file format agnostic?)
       - fr('a', END) { ['a'] END > fr('a', END) } main { [#] fr('a', END) }
          -> main { ['#'] > fr('a', END)}
       
abstract
 - grammar
    - comments
    - dot call chaining
    - $$ current char??? - huge machines; maybe not
 - compiler
    - short name mode
    - real executable instead of parse_test

concrete
 - fix parser
 - more control over simulation
 - use 0x00 as blank instead of 0x5f

ctm
 - see where ambiguities are?
 - compressed format with dictionary?
