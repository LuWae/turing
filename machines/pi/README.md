# Turing Machines to calculate &#960;, e, ...

This project aims to design turing machines that calculate important numbers.

Numbers are calculated to arbitrary precision. More specifically, for any natural number n there exists a finite number T<sub>n</sub> so that after T<sub>n</sub> steps, the turing machine has written the first n digits of the requested number on the tape. The turing machines never terminate.

These machines have no practical relevance, they are merely created for fun and to use them in other projects. The design uses **Skeleton Tables** from Turing's original 1936 paper, which can be expanded trivially to form concrete turing machines. For more information on the design, check the **DESIGN** files.

Current progress:
 - &#960;: in progress
 - e: planned
